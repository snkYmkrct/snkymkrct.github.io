| Breathe Easy - an air quality monitor | Project built for the “Making Embedded Systems” class held by the embedded systems expert and author Elicia White. Made soon after the pandemic, so a useful item to have around. It involved project design, advanced embedded systems topics, low level C coding, working with different sensors, battery monitoring, and 3D printing a lithophane earth shaped warning light. |
| Mushu memorial - lithophane lamp | As a memorial for my beloved cat, Mushu, who passed away due to cancer. Our veterinary oncologist loved Mushu, wanted a memento of him, and asked for a photo. I decided a simple photo would not do justice to his memory, so I created an easy to use battery powered lamp, with a lithophane picture of him, that made a beautiful and unique gift for our vet. | 
| Heart Beats in the Night | Freeform circuit sculptures are made using a fascinating technique that I've seen online, and I wanted to try for myself. It involved creating a circuit out of bare brass rods, shaped as a heart, with simple LEDs and a battery connected to the sculpture. |
