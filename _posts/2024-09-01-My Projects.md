| :--- | :--- | 
| Breathe Easy - an air quality monitor | Project built for the ‚ÄúMaking Embedded Systems‚Äù class held by the embedded systems expert and author Elicia White. Made soon after the pandemic, so a useful item to have around. It involved project design, advanced embedded systems topics, low level C coding, working with different sensors, battery monitoring, and 3D printing a lithophane earth shaped warning light. | 
| Mushu memorial - lithophane lamp | As a memorial for my beloved cat, Mushu, who passed away due to cancer. Our veterinary oncologist loved Mushu, wanted a memento of him, and asked for a photo. I decided a simple photo would not do justice to his memory, so I created an easy to use battery powered lamp, with a lithophane picture of him, that made a beautiful and unique gift for our vet. | 
| Making Daisy Seed open source (again) | The Daisy Seed development board is meant for music creation, and I want to make it easier for artists to use it by adding CircuitPython support. I am reverse engineering and open sourcing the firmware for it. It is a challenging project that the creators were unable, or unwilling, to do, even though it was promised in their crowdsource campaign.| 
| Heart Beats in the Night | Freeform circuit sculptures are made using a fascinating technique that I've seen online, and I wanted to try for myself. It involved creating a circuit out of bare brass rods, shaped as a heart, with simple LEDs and a battery connected to the sculpture. I have another similar project in the works, building a free form circuit clock. |  
| IoT Kitty Scale | IOT scale for my cats, to monitor and log their weight. Meant to be used at meal times, so it can also measure how much they eat, it would automatically weigh the cat sitting on it, and log the data to an online platform. Made out of a large kitchen wooden cutting plate, with load sensors attached, connected to an ESP32 wifi capable board. WIP, because it was planned for the hungrier of the kitties, and those plans got derailed by cancer. | 
| 3D Printer Haus | 3D printer enclosure made out of an IKEA LACK table, and an IKEA storage container as a filament dry box. Includes LED lights for illumination and mood, sensors for temperature / humidity / air particle monitoring, and an IOT warning system. Safety for long prints - also LEDs are cool. | 
| Lightbox | Made out of a large IKEA photo frame, an acrylic plate, and Neopixel LED strands, connected to a CircuitPython board. Needed for tracing sewing patterns easier. Also serving as a lamp when not used. | 
| Hello, My Name Is - an e-ink badge | Displaying QR codes to my contact details, useful as a portable CV when attending events. Programmed in CircuitPython. Also includes a 3D printed case, and LEDs. | 
| Portable Minesweeper | I like Minesweeper, and it was fun to clone a game from scratch, on a microcontroller system with a touchscreen. Coded in CircuitPython. | 
| Lighting in a Frame | Inspired from the youtube video of a "lightning simulation" project with no source code available. I decided to recreate it in CircuitPython on a microcontroller board, to run on a RGB matrix display (WIP) | 
| I Got my Perfboard with Me - a wearable LED bag | I found a purse with golden eyelets that made it look like a big perfboard, and thought it would be a fun wearable to create, by 3D printing oversized electronic components (LEDs, resistors) and making them look like they are actually functioning on the big ‚Äúperfboard‚Äù bag. | 
| Kitty Restaurant | Cats eat easier from a raised surface than directly from the ground. None of the supports I found commercially were appropriate (too big, for dogs, used metal bowls, etc), so I made some customized to our cats' plates, and 3D printed them. |  
| 3D printed project cases | Adafruit designs a variety of cases for their boards, and projects, and I 3D printed a lot of them, including an oversized Lego head, because they are awesome. And useful. To protect the project, of course. | 
| Prusa kits, and printers, and Haribo bears, oh my! | I built my Prusa printer from scratch. Well, from a kit. I wanted to see how it was made, since it‚Äôs an open source machine. Also, it was cheaper, and it came with Haribo bears. | 
| Making the Maker Space - a massive IKEA work table on wheels | I needed a large, mobile, and cheap-ish work surface. I made it out of IKEA shelves, cheap table tops, and wheels. |  
| ‚ÄúCatify to Satisfy‚Äù - balcony edition | I installed a cat safety net on poles all around the apartment‚Äôs open balcony, so my kitties could enjoy the sun and wind, without being able to jump down from the third floor. | 
| ‚ÄúCatify to Satisfy‚Äù - bedroom window | I built a removable window frame with a cat safety net, attached with magnets, in order to be able to open an outside-opening window wide, while keeping the cats safe. | 
| Furniture fun | I like to rescue and upcycle various pieces of furniture, plus repair and customize already owned ones (table, chairs, broken cat scratch pole, outdoor bench, etc) - with glue, hardware, anti rust, painting, decoupage techniques, etc | 
| Sewing fun | I recently learned how to sew to be able to repair, customize, and make clothes in inclusive sizes, matching my style. I have made several pieces of clothing already, following commercial patterns, including a pair of pants made out of recycled bed sheets, a fun jumpsuit with bunny ears, and sports leggings. |
